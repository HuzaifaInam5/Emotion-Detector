# ðŸ˜„ Emotion Detector - CNN with TensorFlow

This project is a **binary emotion classifier** that detects **Happy** and **Sad** faces using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow. The model is trained on an image dataset, evaluated for accuracy, and exported to `.tflite` format for use in **Android apps (via Kotlin)**.
